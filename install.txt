Installation

Download the jqGrid package from the www.trirand/blog site section downloads.
Note the new download manager where you can choose which modules you want to
include in the download.

In order to use jqGrid 3.5, first a UI theme css file should be loaded.
Download the desired theme (or build a custom one) from jQueryUI site
(www.jqueryui.com) and point in your link tag in head section the path to the
theme css

<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" media="screen" href="path_to_ui_css_file/jquery-ui-1.7.1.custom.css" />

where the path_to_ui_css_file is a valid path to the ui theme file

Extract the jqGrid package and copy the ui.jqgrid.css from css directory to
your webserver directory. It is not necessary that the jqgrid css file is in
the same directory as those of the jquery ui css.

<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" media="screen" href="path_to_jqgrid_css_file/ui.jqgrid.css" />

Starting with this version, jqGrid does not use a loader (which loads the
needed files one by one), but all the needed code is contained in one file.
The desired modules can be built using the jqGrid download manager from the
site pointed above. In order to use this, first a language file should be
loaded and then the jqgrid file.

Copy the desired language file from js/i18n directory to your web server
directory where you store the java script files. Every language file is
named grid.locale-XX.js, where XX is a two-letter code for the language.
Copy the jquery.jqGid.min.js file to the same or other valid directory in
your web server

Include both the files in script tags in the head section

<script src="path_to_js_files/grid.locale-en.js" type="text/javascript"></script>
<script src="path_to_js_files/jquery.jqGrid.min.js" type="text/javascript"></script>

For debugging purposes, I have created a grid.loader.js which does the same
loading of the files as in previous versions. The location of the file is in
src directory of the package. In order to use this, the variable pathtojsfiles
should be adjusted to point to the appropriate folder - see 3.4.x docs.
